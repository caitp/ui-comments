###Nested, Reddit-style comments directives for AngularJS

#####[Demo](http://caitp.github.io/ui-comments/) | [Docs](http://caitp.github.io/ui-comments/docs)

Comments are all over the internet these days. It's often not in anyone's best interest to read them, and yet sometimes they offer a certain whimsical charm and hilarity, or otherwise engage you in pop-culture in ways that you'd otherwise miss.

Angular directives can make engineering comment systems very simple, and `$http`, `$resource`, or similar tools can vastly simplify the population of comment data.

The intention of this library is to serve as a simple helper, and perhaps as an example, for a reddit-style comment system, built on two very simple AngularJS directives.

###Development

Building the code is a super-simple exercise:

```bash
$ NODE_ENV=development npm install
$ grunt
```

The above commands will install development dependencies for the library, and run the build and test process (on a single browser, by default).

If desired, it is possible to manually run tests with specific browsers:

- 1) Start the test server:

```bash
$ karma start --browsers PhantomJS [--browsers Chrome [--browsers Firefox]]
```

- 2) After the server and desired browsers are started up, run the tests:

```bash
$ karma run
```

- 3) Alternatively, you can utilize `--single-run` to start the server, execute tests and quit immediately:

```bash
$ karma start [desired --browsers] --single-run
```

Hopefully everything is passing!

Note that it is nice to have a global installation of `karma`, however if this is not available, one can use `./node_modules/grunt-karma/node_modules/karma/bin/karma` instead. That's somewhat more verbose, however!

###Contributing

It would be super cool if this project is actually useful to people, and I know that for what it is currently, there are a lot of things that could be improved on, which I'm not totally sure how to do in a nice way.

- Simpler template customization
- Improved documentation
- Service API for server communication
- More robust testing

So there are lots of things to do, and it would be just awesome if people could help improve them. But, even if people only ever use it as an example for generating nested AngularJS directives, that's fine too. I really just wrote this for fun, but I hope that people can get some use out of it as well.

Then again, it works pretty well!
